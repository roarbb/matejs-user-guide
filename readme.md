# Conditions I like to work in
Ideally small autonomous team of engineers (Spotify model) which worked great in the past (hackathon, small group to fight tight deadline). I struggle with distractions in open office and would often wear headphones without any music playing. I also like to use mechanical keyboards.
# Times and hours I like to work
I'm not productive in the morning, that's why I like to ride my bicycle before work and arrive to the office as latest as possible. I'm usually in the office 10am - 6pm. I work almost every day on my pet projects after work 8pm - 10pm.
# The best ways to communicate with me
I prefer slack, email or any king of written communication. I don't mind desk bombing. I probably won't answer your phone call.
# Ways I like to receive feedback
I genuinely love any kind of feedback. As people don't do it often enough, my preffered way of feedback is mentoring. I've been lucky to work with great mentors and with people I looked up to back in Europe, still looking for someone here in Australia.
# Things I need
I need to be able to switch to Colemak keyboard layout. I've make the switch few years ago and due to muscle memory I can't use qwerty anymore.
# Things I struggle with
- Making friends with human beings, dogs and cats are usually ok. 
- I usually avoid any social gatherings that involves only sitting and talking. However I'll say yes to any physical activities, sport or activity with the purpose (go carts, climbing, hiking, hackathon, video/board games).
- Working under pressure.
# Things I love
I love learning new things and trying new tech stacks, podcasts and audio books. I like to build, repair and ride bicycles. Camping and bikepacking.
# Other things to know about me
- I like the idea of minimalism, I could fit all my belongings to a small car and move to another city at any time.
- As a kid I was part of a dance group for more than 10 years and I learned German for 12 years.
- I also don't speak German and I don't know how to dance ðŸ˜„
